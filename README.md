# The Mixer
We need new shiny mixer. Nothing in the market with _our_ bell and whitles. So, only one way is possible - custom build. There is the place where we will add some requirements.

# How to add
Just create an issue, after short reviewing you dreams will appear here. Or drop me a line via pacany_zakazali@inbox.lv

 - 4..6 independent line channels (+ phone output on every) + three different levels 0..150,  0..250, 0..1000 mV
 - RCA jacks + thin jack for every
 - No crossfader
 - Level meter for the every channel + master
 - As minimum three independent outputs, dedicated volume regulator for every (one master, one booth, one recording)
 - No balanced\unbalanced outputs, because there is home mixer.
 - Knobs will be from https://store.djtechtools.com/products/chroma-caps-knobs-and-faders
 - CUE buttons on every channel
 - Minimum two output for phones, with regulated output.
 - All connections in the back side.
 - Socket for a lamp?
