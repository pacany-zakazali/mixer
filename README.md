# The Mixer
We need new shiny mixer. Nothing in the market with _our_ bell and whitles. So, only one way is possible - custom build. There is the place where we will add some requirements.

# How to add
Just create an issue, after short reviewing you dreams will appear here. Or drop me a line via pacany_zakazali@inbox.lv

# Requirements
 - 4..6 independent line channels (+ phone output on every)
 - RCA jacks + thin jack for every
 - No crossfader
 - Level meter for the every channel + master
 - As minimum three independent outputs, dedicated volume regulator for every (one master, one booth, one recording)
 - No balanced\unbalanced outputs, because there is home mixer.
